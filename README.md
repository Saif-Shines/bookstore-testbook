so there are some gaps in my understading in writing unit tests. this repository is an attempt to write unit tests using mocha and chai. don't ask why mocha+chai because only god knows answer to that. 

app just does a CRUD operations using REST APIs talking to mongodb.

Tip

```sh
# To run MongoDB (i.e. the mongod process) as a macOS service, issue the following:

brew services start mongodb-community@4.4

# To stop a mongod running as a macOS service, use the following command as needed:

brew services stop mongodb-community@4.4
```

as usual, `npm test` to run the tests.
